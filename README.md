# TargetSupercontigs
Phylogenomics: extract supercontigs from (draft) genome assemblies for more effective target capture sequencing in **closely related species**

Phylogenomic projects typically use exons as their targets, often regardless of the fact that their study group consists of very recently diverged, and hence closely related, taxa. This results in
